### Komodo Platform Overview

After years of innovation and development, Komodo's multi-chain architecture overcomes the challenges faced by other smart-contract platforms.

The philosophy behind Komodo's multi-chain architecture relies on four pillars.

- Security
- Scalability
- Interoperability
- Adaptability

With these four pillars in place, users of all types will find powerful, customizable solutions that will set your blockchain creativity free.

### Security

#### Enjoy the Protection of the Bitcoin Hash Rate

Secure your project with the power of the Bitcoin network via Komodo’s delayed proof of work security mechanism. Don’t waste time worrying about attackers.

</div>

<div style="clear: both;">

- Approximately every half hour, a hash of the developers blockchain is notarized to Bitcoin
- All transactions included in the hash are considered to have achieved finality
- For the consensus mechanism, arbitrarily choose between a mixture of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake

### Scalability

#### Have a Blockchain All To Yourself. Want More Than One? No Problem.

Developers and their users have a full Smart Chain all to themselves, and can combine any number of Smart Chains together into one cluster. 

</div>

<div style="clear: both;">

- Developers and their users can securely own a full Smart Chain
- Each Smart Chain is completely autonomous
- If your project grows beyond the capacity of a single chain, simply add more
- Scale your maximum transaction-per-second throughput into the millions, if desired
- No gas fees. All transaction fees are paid in your Smart Chain’s coin

### Interoperability 

#### Link Your Smart Chain to Other Chains

Your project is interoperable with all others in the Komodo ecosystem, plus connected with over 99% of coins and tokens through Komodo’s industry-leading atomic-swap technology.

</div>

<div style="clear: both;">

- Komodo’s Multi-Chain Syncing feature allows you to scale out linearly on demand
- Smart Chains can verify and update local state based on the activity of compatible Smart Chains
- Transfer assets and tokens between compatible Smart Chains
- Use Komodo's atomic-swap DEX software to trade your Smart Chain assets with Non-Smart assets.

</div>

<div style="clear: both;">

- Twenty-four different launch parameters are available to customize the functionality of your Smart Chain
- Rely on the Antara framework to fully customize your Smart Chain with unique and arbitrary code within the consensus mechanism
- Share and adopt code in Komodo's open-source community
- Dispose of Smart Chains that become data-weight heavy, or transfer them to fresh Smart Chains for ease of use
- No need for a virtual machine (VM) nor a VM-based programming language

</div>
